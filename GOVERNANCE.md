Welcome to the Angel community! This document explains where to get help, and different ways to be part of the community. 

The Angel project community comprises a group of core committer and a sub-group that forms the Technical Steering Committee (the "TSC") which governs the project.

## TSC

The Technical Steering Committee (the "TSC") will be responsible for all technical oversight of the open source Project, which include:

- Technical direction
- Approving project or system proposals
- GitHub repository hosting
- Contribution policy
- Conduct guidelines
- Maintaining the list of additional Committers

### TSC Membership

The TSC voting members are initially the Projectâ€™s Committers. TSC memberships are not time-limited. There is no maximum size of the TSC. The size is expected to vary in order to ensure adequate coverage of important areas of expertise, balanced with the ability to make decisions efficiently. The TSC must have at least three members.

The TSC may add additional members to the TSC by a 2/3 majority vote.
